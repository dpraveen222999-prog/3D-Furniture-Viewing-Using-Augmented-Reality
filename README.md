This project is a browser-based augmented reality application for interactive 3D furniture visualization using WebXR and Three.js. Users can place, view, and customize realistic furniture models within their actual environment in real time, without installing an app. Features include accurate surface detection, dynamic lighting adaptation, and an intuitive scrollable UI for model selection—enabling seamless and accessible AR experiences across devices.
